# liri-node-app
LIRI node.js and API collecting program

Essentially this server side application is to show capability of node.js functionality.
The program is able to access the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs using secret keys. 
On running, program needs to be called: ex. "node liri.js spotify-this-song fantasy" (*note the spaces because program is space sensitive)
